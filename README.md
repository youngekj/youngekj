### Hi there, ðŸ‘‹
My name is Kyle and I am a current Aerospace Engineering student at Iowa State University. I am currently taking AerE 361 which is teaching me all about Git and Github! I am interested in learning more about high power computing and data management for these types of machines. Currently I am working on learning Python since I know Matlab fairly well but want to have a grasp on Python since it's an industry standard for the most part. When I'm not studying or working, I love to ski, hike, and travel.
